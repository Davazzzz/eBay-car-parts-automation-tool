  WHEN YOU RETURN WITH eBay API CREDENTIALS
====================================================================

Hi! When you're back with your eBay API credentials, here's what to do:

1. OPEN CLAUDE CODE
   - Your conversation is saved automatically
   - Just open Claude Code the same way you did today

2. TELL ME YOU'RE BACK
   Simply type one of these:
   - "I'm back with the API credentials"
   - "Got my eBay keys"
   - "Continue"

3. PROVIDE YOUR CREDENTIALS
   When you have them from https://developer.ebay.com/, paste them like:

   App ID: ABC123...
   Cert ID: XYZ789...
   Dev ID: DEF456...

4. I'LL SET EVERYTHING UP
   - Add credentials to .env file
   - Install dependencies
   - Run the app
   - Test it with a sample vehicle

====================================================================
  GETTING eBay CREDENTIALS (if you haven't already)
